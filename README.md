# BScProject_SuperResolutionOfSatelliteImagery

**Abstract.** This project explores the capabilities and limitations of generative adversarial network (GAN) based single image super-resolution (SISR) for the downscaling of satellite images. It demonstrates the need of specific training by confronting a model trained on Sentinel-2A images to its generically trained counterpart. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of a bespoke framework by not being able to downscale Landsat 8 images satisfactorily with the well-performing specifically trained model.
